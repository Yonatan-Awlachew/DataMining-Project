# Data Mining Project: Modeling and Analysis of Italy's Agricultural Economy Using Historical Data (1980-2023)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on modeling and analyzing Italyâ€™s agricultural economy from 1980 to 2023, leveraging machine learning and data mining techniques to uncover valuable insights. By applying both supervised and unsupervised learning models, I explored trends, economic impacts, and key factors influencing agricultural production.

## Data Collection
Data obtained from EUROSTAT
**Dataset Source :** [Italy's Agricultural Dataset  ](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/data/database)

## Data Preparation
Steps include loading data, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and splitting the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, and feature selection.
<!-- ### Methods Used: -->

## Classification Analysis
Algorithms used: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN,
  - SVM and
  - Naive Bayes

## Cluster Analysis
Clustering techniques were applied to identify patterns in agricultural economic impact. 

### Methods Used:
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) by plotting within-cluster sum of squares.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Used to segment data into clusters based on economic factors.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Applied to examine data grouping based on similarity.

## Results and Insights
Key findings include a strong correlation between subsidies and economic impact, and distinct economic clusters based on production efficiency.

## Visualizations
Includes feature distributions, model performance metrics, clustering results, and trend analysis.
